# Prime_E AngleMod Case
![prime_e_anglemod](img/prime_e_anglemod.jpg)

Angled case design for the Prime_E keyboard. Includes two sets of files:

+ Unbroken case for large format printers 
+ Logically split case for smaller print beds

**Please note: the current design is only compatible with the Rev1 Prime_E PCB**
## Assembly

The case is assembled using M3 screws and heatset inserts.  If you are printing the split version of the case note that some finshing will be required on the top of the case to get a "seamless" look.
